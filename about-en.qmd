Hi! My name is Jeanne Franco. During my undergraduate and graduate studies at the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte](https://www.ufrn.br/), I needed to collect, organize, and analyze data to conduct my scientific research. This led me to develop an interest in statistical analyses and data visualization using R software. Since then, I have been dedicating myself to this field through courses and gaining professional experience. My professional and volunteer experiences at [Beta Analítica](https://betaanalitica.com.br/) and at the [R-Ladies de Natal](https://rladies.org/)[^1] community include:

[^1]: R-Ladies is a global nonprofit organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity and provide courses on the R programming language.

\- Consulting, lectures, and online courses on data visualization in R.

\- R programming: data analysis with the tidyverse, report and dashboard production with R Markdown, website and blog creation using the Quarto system, HTML and CSS markup languages, application development with the Shiny package, storytelling, and creating flexible and elegant tables with the gtsummary package.

\- Data analysis skills: importing, extracting, transforming, and visualizing data (bar charts, histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, line charts, maps, word clouds, and multivariate analysis graphs).

\- Statistical knowledge: descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error calculations), generalized linear models (GLM, GLMM, GAM, GAMM), structural equation modeling, simple and multiple linear regression, analysis of variance, and multivariate analyses (NMDS, RDA, PCA, CCA).

\- Basic knowledge of Machine Learning, Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI.
