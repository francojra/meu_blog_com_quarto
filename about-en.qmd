Hi, my name is Jeanne Franco. During my postgraduate studies at the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte](https://www.ufrn.br/), in order to carry out my scientific research, I needed to collect, organize and analyze data. This led me to develop an interest in data analysis and visualization using R software. Since then, I have dedicated myself to this area through courses and gained professional experience through consultancies and lectures. My professional and volunteer experiences include: 1. Consulting in data analysis, data visualization and scientific production at [Beta Analítica](https://betaanalitica.com.br/); 2. Programming in R: manipulating and visualizing data with the tidyverse package, producing reports with R Markdown, producing websites and blogs in R using the Quarto system, HTML and CSS markup languages and producing applications with the Shiny package; 3. Basic knowledge of Python and SQL, and organizing the [R-Ladies de Natal](https://rladies.org/) community[^1].

[^1]: R-Ladies is a global non-profit organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity and teach courses on the R programming language.
