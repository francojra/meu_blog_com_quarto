Hello, my name is Jeanne Franco! I have a bachelor's degree in Ecology, a master's degree in Forest Science and a PhD in Ecology from the [Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte](https://www.ufrn.br/). During my graduate and doctoral studies I gained experience evaluating the effect of native tree and herbaceous species diversity on the ecological restoration of degraded semi-arid environments. During my master's degree I conducted field investigations to evaluate the natural regeneration of tree species in a mangrove area.

I am a contributor to [Beta Analítica](https://betaanalitica.com.br/), a company with experts in data processing, statistical analysis and R programming, helping university students, individuals and the business public. I am also a co-organizer of [R-Ladies de Natal](https://rladies.org/), an organization with a mission to promote gender diversity through meetings to disseminate knowledge of the R language.

I am interested in restoration ecology, plant ecology, invasive exotic species, recovery of degraded areas, data science with R Software, and scientific outreach.
