Hello, my name is Jeanne Franco! I am graduated in Ecology, Master in Forest Sciences and PhD in Ecology from the [Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte](https://www.ufrn.br/). During my undergraduate and doctoral studies I acquired experience evaluating the effect of native tree species diversity and the effect of herbaceous species on the ecological restoration of degraded semi-arid environments. During my master's degree I carried out field investigations to evaluate the natural regeneration of tree species in a mangrove area.

I am a collaborator at [Beta Analítica](https://betaanalitica.com.br/), a company with experts in data processing, statistical analysis and R programming, helping university students, individuals and corporate public. I am also a co-organizer of [R-Ladies de Natal](https://rladies.org/), an organization with the mission of promoting gender diversity through meetings to disseminate knowledge of the R language.

I am interested in restoration ecology, plant ecology, invasive exotic species, recovery of degraded areas, data science with R Software, scientific outreach and artwork of painting and drawing.
