Hi! My name is Jeanne Franco. During my postgraduate studies at [Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte](https://www.ufrn.br/), to conduct my scientific research, I needed to collect, organize, and analyze data. This led me to develop an interest in data analysis and visualization using the R software. Since then, I have been dedicated to this area through courses and have gained professional experience through consulting and giving lectures. My professional and volunteer experiences include:\
\
▪ Consulting in data analysis, data visualization, and scientific production at [Beta Analítica](https://betaanalitica.com.br/).\
\
▪ R programming: data manipulation and visualization (dataviz) with the tidyverse package, report production with R Markdown, website and blog production in R using Quarto system, HTML and CSS markup languages, and application production with the Shiny package.\
\
▪ Knowledge in Python and SQL.\
\
▪ Organizer and speaker: R-Ladies Natal community. R-Ladies is a global non-profit organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity and provide courses on the R programming language.\
\
▪ Book reviewer: Translation of the book "R for Data Science 2nd Edition." Organization: R-Ladies São Paulo.
